Rogue Hack Lab "secrets".

In general:
 * use 'hosted-services@roguehacklab.com' as email address when signing up for services on behalf of
   Rogue Hack Lab.
 * treat the gpg passphrase with care (don't record it, email it, IM it...)
 * keep secrets.sh working as a shell script (```source secrets.sh``` shouldn't error)

Working with secrets.sh
 * make sure your local git clone is up-to-date before touching anything; merging is hard.
 * decrypt secrets.sh.gpg with gpg --decrypt secrets.sh.gpg > secrets.sh
 * record usernames/passwords and details into secrets.sh
 * encrypt secrets.sh with gpg --symmetric secrets.sh
 * don't leave secrets.sh laying around unencrypted!
